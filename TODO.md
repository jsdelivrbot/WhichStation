# TO DO

* Use the Huxley service to translate to and from station CRS codes (e.g. *Bristol Parkway* = ***BPW***).
* Write the station chooser using Redux Form, allowing for new station choices to be added or removed from the list. 
* Provide active dropdowns for looking up stations.
* Write tests, especially unit tests for *utils/date.js*.
* Handle error conditions, especially when using the Huxley service.
